[05:39:43] [WARNING] parameter 'User-Agent' does not seem to be injectable
[05:39:45] [CRITICAL] all tested parameters do not appear to be injectable. Also, you can try to rerun by providing a valid value for option '--string' as perhaps the string you have chosen does not match exclusively True responses. If you suspect that there is some kind of protection mechanism involved (e.g. WAF) maybe you could try to use option '--tamper' (e.g. '--tamper=space2comment') and/or switch '--random-agent'
