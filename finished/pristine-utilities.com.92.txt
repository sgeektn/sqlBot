[11:49:33] [WARNING] parameter 'Referer' does not seem to be injectable
[11:49:33] [CRITICAL] all tested parameters do not appear to be injectable. You can give it a go with the switch '--text-only' if the target page has a low percentage of textual content (~51.50% of page content is text). If you suspect that there is some kind of protection mechanism involved (e.g. WAF) maybe you could try to use option '--tamper' (e.g. '--tamper=space2comment')
